        The Game Is About Glory.<br>

        The words of our 1961 Double-winning captain Danny Blanchflower reverberate around Tottenham Hotspur and everything we do, to this day and into the future.<br><br>
        We are about playing with flair, style and passion. Players, coaches, staff and fans – we move forward, together as one.<br><br>
        We’re hungry, we’re progressive, we’ve built a brand new world-class Training Centre and moved into an outstanding, modern new stadium, overlapping the site of White Hart Lane, where we played our home games for 118 years.
